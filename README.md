# Blaze Masters

Blaze Masters is a serious game inspired by current events related to forest fires. Our team realized that people at an individual elvel needed to understand more how proper forest and vegetation maintenance is to be done and some other truths we were unaware of about forest fires. 
The game was developed with the Box design with initial constraints of a mobile platform and an art style whcih in our case was Art Nouveau.
The game was made for mobile platform in Unity. The main scene is a 2D screen with 4 buttons for possible actions that allow you to either grow another tree, cut a tree down, water a tree or do a survey on a certain area to elarn more abotu whta is gong on there. A fire will start sporadically and trees will get sick. Sick tress spread fire quicker and wider so it is recommended for those to get cut. The player win condition is set by being abel to keep the forest from getting completely burned and abel to have 40 trees by growing them and mantaining it.
